A short talk to demonstrate OAuth2 support with Mojolicious, showing
available modules/plugins to make this a bit easier. Broken up in to
four parts:

1) A quick explanation of OAuth2 - is that even possible? I guess we
will find out...

2) Client side implementation - Mojolicious::Plugin::OAuth2

3) Server side implementation - Mojolicious::Plugin::OAuth2::Server

4) Q&A

Familiarity with Mojolicious is and advantage, but is not required
